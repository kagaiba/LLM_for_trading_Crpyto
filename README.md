This Python project implements a robust, end-to-end framework for developing and backtesting a mean-reversion Pairs Trading strategy using cryptocurrency data. The strategy employs statistical arbitrage principles to identify cointegrated asset pairs, automatically runs a backtest based on Z-Score thresholds, and ranks the best-performing pairs by their risk-adjusted return (Sharpe Ratio).

The methodology integrates Machine Learning (K-Means Clustering) to efficiently pre-select candidate pairs, focusing the rigorous Cointegration Test only on economically similar assets to improve the probability of finding reliable relationships.
